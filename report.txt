Abstract
Simulation of HBT Interferometer assuming detectors are NOT point-sized but have spatial extent. We find that the result does not fundamentally change compared to the point-size case, but the contrast gets worse.



Introduction
- HBT effect (double slit)
- in astronomy
- assumption of point detector

Method: Expanding the detectors
 2 det case
 - 1 dim case (2  point sources, to be sure that G2 gets to 0 at detector seperation = fringewidth)
 - 2 dim case (1 'big' source, homogen, inhomogen)
 - analytical solution (integral)
 - simulation

 3 Detector Case
 - expanding 2 det case

Interpretation
 - contrast worse
 - in 3 detector case: imaginary part is different as in the 2 det case (meaning? important?)

Conclusion
 - result more or less the same, but with less contrast
