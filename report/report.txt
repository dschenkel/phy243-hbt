Abstract
Simulation of HBT Interferometer assuming detectors are NOT point-sized but have spatial extent. We find that the result does not fundamentally change compared to the point-size case, but the contrast gets worse.



Introduction
The HBT effect describes the fact that light from an incoherent source when measured at two points will produce a coincidence rate which is slightly higher than the expected Poisson coincidence rate. This additional term in the coincidence rate is the HBT effect and it can be used to do intensity interferometry on stars with two detectors as done by Hanbury Brown & Twiss (195?)(H B and T implemented this idea the first time in 1958). More recently, research has been done on the feasibility of using three detectors to recover the phase information a well. Most of this research has been done assuming that only the source has a spatial extent, with the detectors being point-sized. In this paper we analyze if and how detectors with spatial extent affect the result. First we present an analytical solution in a simplified 1-Dimensional double-slit situation with two detectors. We then expand our model into two dimensions and analyze the results for both two and three detectors. (where we don't have two point sources as in the double-slit situation anymore but one disk of point sources auscho do erwähne evt. also dases halt nüm s'doppelspalt experiment isch sozege im 2d case. oder meinsch nid?)


Method: Expanding the detectors
In its simplest form, the HBT effect can be thought of as Young’s double slit experiment done with an incoherent light source. In such a case the correlation at any point on the screen is G(2) as shown by Glauber (2006; eq 19?++). By integrating G(x1,x2)=exp(ik(x1-x2)theta1)+exp(ik(x1-x2)theta2) and G(x2,x1)= exp(ik(x2-x1)theta1)+exp(ik(x2-x1)theta2) over ±∆x and taking the absolute value we get the signal as measured by a detector with a spatial extent 2∆x. To verify our result, we test the case in which the detector size is approximately the same as the fringe with. As expected, the measured signal drops to zero (fig. X).

The same result can be found by taking the fourier transform of the source and multiplying it with the detectors. This will be used to facilitate the simulation of the 2d case. 

In the 2-Dimensional case the source is not a double slit anymore but a disk of point sources. This source can either be homogenous or an inhomogenous source with different valued spots (see fig. X). The detectors are equally modeled by a uniform disk. We multiply the source with de inverse fourier transformation of the detectors and transformed it back in the fourier space to get G(2).
 
 2 det case
 - 1 dim case (2  point sources, to be sure that G2 gets to 0 at detector separation = fringewidth)
	- analytical solution (integral) by convoluting G2 with detector
 	we get it to 0
 - same result when using fourier transforms -> we now know that this works

 - 2 dim case (1 'big' source, homogen, inhomogen)

 - simulation -> fourier
 - 2d case by modeling disks. same model can be used for source and detector. 2 sources: either a homogenous one which is a simple disk, or an inhomogenous    source with different valued spots on it (see fig.)

 3 Detector Case
 - expanding 2 det case. a simple matter of multiply another (inverse transformed detector)term in place-space and transform it back into k-space to get G(2)

Interpretation
 - contrast worse
 - in 3 detector case: imaginary part is different as in the 2 det case (meaning? important?)

Conclusion
 - result more or less the same, but with less contrast
